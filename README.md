# GMPermissions
###### Credit and thanks to WolfDale for writing the first version of this plugin


GMPermissions is a simple PocketMine plugin that adds permissions to limit access to gamemode commands.

**PERMISSIONS:**

gmchange.others

gmchange.spectator

gmchange.nogm


Give the gmchange.nogm permission to allow players to use the /nogm command, which prevents anyone from changing your gamemode

Use the normal pocketmine.command.gamemode permission to give players the ability to change their own gamemode.

Give the gmchange.others permission to allow players to change anyone's gamemode

Give the gmchange.spectator permission to allow players to use spectator mode
